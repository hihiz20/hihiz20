## 😎 About Me  
Hello there! 👋 My name is Hizkia Permata and I'm an aspiring researcher and educator with a passion for AI and problem 
solving. My goal is to leverage technology and research to tackle real-world challenges. I believe in using technology and 
research for greater impact—bridging AI education to create meaningful solutions. My work is driven by a passion to serve 
society through science, research, and teaching. 

🎯 Fun Fact:
- I grew up around academia—so you could say research is in my DNA! (Yes, I’m a professor’s child 😉).
- Started teaching early! I volunteer to teach Math, English, and Music at age 14 in my parents ministry.
- I can speak 5 languages (My parents speaks 6, dang so close!).
- I am a third culture kid and traveled around the world.
