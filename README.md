## About Me  
Hello there! 👋 My name is Hizkia Permata and I am a Computer Science major. I'm an aspiring researcher and educator with a 
passion for AI and problem solving to make a difference in society. I believe true innovation comes with working with a field 
not of my own but collaborating with people in different backgrounds. My work is driven by a passion to serve society through 
technology, research, and teaching. 

🎯 Fun Fact:
- I grew up around academia (I’m a professor’s child 😉).
- Started teaching early! I volunteer to teach Math, English, and Music at age 14 in my parents ministry.
- I can speak 5 languages (My parents speaks 6, dang so close!).
- I am a third culture kid and traveled around the world.
- I love starfish and moon jellyfish.
